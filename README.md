# Negative Sampling Probability Annealing for Deep Metric Learning

Original EmbeddingNet framework is available at https://github.com/kerteszg/EmbeddingNet. Kudos to the original creators: https://github.com/RocketFlash/EmbeddingNet. 

This repository contains the algorithms and materials used in experiments described in ***Deep Metric Learning using Negative Sampling Probability Annealing***, [submitted to *MDPI Sensors* as an Open Access research article](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors).

## Dataset
### NIST SD19

To prove the discriminative ability of the proposed method by experiments, the NIST SD19 dataset was used. After highlighting and transformation, different experiments were performed using a similar backbone architecture.

Results showed, that the MDIPFL based approach achieves similar performance, despite of the significantly lower number of parameters.
